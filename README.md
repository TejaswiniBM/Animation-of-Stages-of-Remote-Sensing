# Animation-of-Stages-of-Remote-Sensing
Remote Sensing - an art or science of observing and gathering information about any object, scene, or phenomenon which exists at a remote location from the point of observation. 

Stages of Remote Sensing are as follows:
1. Energy Source (A):- Sun is the main source of light energy which strikes the earth surface features through Electro-Magnetic Radiation.
2. Radiation and Atmosphere (B):- EMR interacts with the atmospheric elements while travelingfrom its source to the target. This may obstruct the accuracy of the data collection.
3. Interaction with the Target (C):- Radiation that is not absorbed or scattered in the atmosphere can reach and interact with the Earth’s surface. Different objects return different amount of energy depending on the physical, chemical optical properties.
4. Recording of Energy by the Sensor (D):- After the energy has been emitted from the target, the reflected wavelength will be collected and recorded by the sensors. Error may occur during the data collection due to difference in surface roughness, angle of incidence, intensity, and wavelength of radiant energy.
5. Transmission, Reception, and Processing (E):- The energy recorded by the sensor will transmit the data in electronic form to the nearest observation station. Then the detection and discrimination of earth’s feature will be done to form final image.
6. Interpretation and Analysis (F):- Later the processed image will be interpreted visually and digitally to extract specific information of the particular features.
